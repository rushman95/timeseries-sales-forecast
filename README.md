# timeseries-sales-forecast

This project builds and deploys two machine learning models to forecast sales for an American retailer with 10 stores across three states and three product categories: 
* The first model predicts item-store sales revenue based on a given date.
* The second model forecasts total sales revenue for the next 7 days, based on a given date.
